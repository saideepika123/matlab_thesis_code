% You need to run this code if and only if you are trying to train your own Neural Network. 
% This Code reads the EMNIST dataset and convert the dataset as variables 
% suitable for "nprtool". It is supposed that you already have download the
% EMNST Dataset from the url https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/emnist and
% kept it in same directory where this code is present.
% After running this code two variables, named as 'targetsd' and 'inputs' 
% make sure you save them as .mat file
close all
